ClipVault – Setup Information (Before Install)
=============================================

Thank you for trying ClipVault.

What ClipVault does
-------------------

- Monitors your Windows clipboard for text you copy.
- Stores snippets in a local SQLite database (`history.db`) on your machine.
- Lets you search, browse, and re‑copy past snippets from a simple GUI.
- Can run in the background with a tray icon so it keeps working even when
  the main window is closed.

What ClipVault does NOT do
--------------------------

- It does **not** send your snippets to any server.
- It does **not** share your data with other users on the same machine unless
  they have access to your Windows account files.

Security / privacy note
-----------------------

- Snippets are stored **unencrypted** in `history.db`.
- Any process or user that can read your user files can, in principle, read
  the clipboard history.
- Be mindful of copying highly sensitive data (e.g. passwords, keys,
  private documents) if you do not want them retained in a local history.

System requirements
-------------------

- Windows 10 or Windows 11, 64‑bit.
- No separate Python installation is required; ClipVault is distributed as a
  self‑contained executable.

Recommended usage
-----------------

- Install ClipVault into the default location unless you have a good reason
  to change it.
- Optionally enable the “Start with Windows” option so the clipboard history
  is always available.

By continuing with the installation, you confirm that you have read and
understood the above information. ClipVault is provided “as is”, without
warranty of any kind; use at your own risk.
