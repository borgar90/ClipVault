ClipVault – Setup Complete
==========================

ClipVault has been installed on this computer.

Where to find ClipVault
-----------------------

- Start Menu: a “ClipVault” entry was added under your programs.
- Optional: a desktop shortcut was created if you selected that option in
  the installer.

How ClipVault behaves
---------------------

- When you run ClipVault, it starts monitoring your clipboard for new text
  snippets and stores them in a local `history.db` file.
- Closing the main window using the X button does **not** stop monitoring.
  Instead, the window is hidden and ClipVault continues running in the
  background.
- A tray icon (under “show hidden icons” in the Windows taskbar) shows that
  ClipVault is active.

Tray icon menu
--------------

- **Show ClipVault** – restores the main window so you can search and copy
  snippets.
- **Quit** – stops monitoring and exits ClipVault completely.

Autostart (if selected)
-----------------------

- If you chose to start ClipVault with Windows, it will launch automatically
  when you log in. You can change this later by:
  - Unchecking ClipVault in the Startup section of Task Manager, or
  - Removing its entry from `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.

Data location
-------------

- The clipboard history is stored in a file named `history.db`, created next
  to the ClipVault executable or in its configured data directory.
- Deleting this file (while ClipVault is not running) will erase all stored
  history.
